Armour
Rune armour is the highest-quality non-degradable armour that free-to-play players can wear, and the second-highest quality armour on the standard metallic armour spectrum (bronze to dragon). Rune armour requires 40 Defence to wear and Dragon Slayer I to wear the rune platebody, but only 40 Defence to wear all other pieces (thus, Dragon Slayer I need not be completed). With a full set costing around 129,943 coins, the armour provides excellent Defence for its price, making it the best choice for warriors with level 40 Defence.

Other
Ornamental rune armour, such as heraldic, trimmed, god armour, and gilded armour have the same bonuses as standard rune armour, with the addition of a +1 prayer bonus on god armour, and the exception of the ranged attack bonus of the god and trimmed variants of the kiteshield being -2 rather than -3. These can be obtained from the member's only Treasure Trails minigame. These armour sets are often worn by more wealthy players due to their looks and price.

Note: Other players cannot trim or bless armour. Players claiming to do so are scammers.
