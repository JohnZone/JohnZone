Effective hourly profit is the amount of money you would make in an hour if you could continuously use these money makers. It is best not to use activities that have an effective profit less than what you can normally make otherwise.

Note that you can only do one type of herb farming at once, one type of brewing at once, and one of either picking papayas or coconuts.

Stronghold of Security

A map of the Stronghold of Security.
Players can visit the Stronghold of Security for some quick coins. Players can get 10,000 just for completing the first three levels. This can be done even at Combat level 3, making it a good way to obtain your first bit of money.

Miscellaneous methods
Merchanting
Main article: Merchanting
Grand Exchange flipping, or merchanting, is the high-risk, high-reward activity of buying items for a low price and selling them at a higher price. You are looking for items that are unstable, but are frequently traded, with a changing price due to supply and demand.

Untradeable supplies
Certain money making methods use untradeable supplies that are gathered passively through normal gameplay, the time taken to gather these ingredients is impossible to objectively quantify with a specific value so they are assumed to be "zero time" to gather in these guides.
