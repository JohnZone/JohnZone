Step 1: A1Z26
A1Z26

The A1Z26 code is a very simple code. As you know there are 26 letters in the American alphabet so Z would equal 26 because it is the 26th letter in the alphabet.

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26

Step 2: ASCII
ASCII
ASCII

ASCII is a computer code that is similar to binary. Instead of using 1's and 0's like binary it uses the numbers from 1-256

A=65

B=66

C=67

D=68

E=69

F=70

G=71

H=72

I=73

J=74

K=75

L=76

M=77

N=78

O=79

P=80

Q=81

R=82

S=83

T=84

U=85

V=86

W=87

X=88

Y=89

Z=90

a=97

b=98

c=99

d=100

e=101

f=102

g=103

h=104

i=105

j=106

k=107

l=108

m=109

n=110

o=111

p=112

q=113

r=114

s=115

t=116

u=117

v=118

w=119

x=120

y=121

z=122

0=48

1=49

2=50

3=51

4=52

5=53

6=54

7=55

8=56

9=57

Step 3: Atbash
Atbash
Atbash

The Atbash code is just the alphabet backwards. For example A would equal Z.

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

Z Y X W V U T S R Q P O N M L K J I H G F E D C B A

Step 4: Binary
Binary

The Binary code is a code that the computers recognize using only 1's and 0's. It is a very complicated code because they are different for lowercase and capital.

Step 5: Braille
Braille
Braille

Braille is what blind people read. It is a series of raised dots that tell you what letter, number, or word it is.

Step 6: Caesar Cipher
Caesar Cipher

The Caesar cipher is a code Julius Caesar invented when he mailed letters. He invented it so if his messenger was robbed of that letter and the robber wouldn't be able to read it. It is probably one of the most simple codes ever. It is 3 letters back so A would be X. The Rot Cipher is almost the same as the Caesar Cipher.

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

X Y Z A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W

Step 7: Columnar Cipher
Columnar Cipher

The Columnar Cipher is a type of transposition cipher.

1. Get Keyword

2. If your keyword is Zebras, that is 6 letters. You would write 632415 because Z is the 6th highest letter in the word and E is the 3rd highest letter and so on

3. Then message under the numbers in rows of 6, because Zebra is a 6 letter word.

4. Write out 123456. Under the number write the letters from each column that match the numbers in the original line of numbers.

Step 8: Combination Cipher
Combination Cipher

A Combination Cipher is a Cipher using 2 or more codes. For example if you wanted to make the best code ever, you could do Atbash, Caesar Cipher, Vigernere Cipher, and then A1Z26.

Step 9: Dice Cipher
Dice Cipher

The Dice Cipher is not dice, it's just squares with dots in certain places.

Step 10: Digraph Cipher
Digraph Cipher
Digraph Cipher

The Digraph Cipher is kind of like the Vigenere Cipher. When you write a sentence you would write it in pairs of twos, li ke th is, and if there is a letter left over add an x to it. The pairs of letters will be the coordinates for the two letters. An example would be "IA MT RY IN GT OE XP LA IN TH IS" = "VG ZN EI VT TN BC KR YG VT GZ VO". To decipher it the decoded letters will be the coordinates.

Step 11: Dorabella Cipher
Dorabella Cipher
Dorabella Cipher

The Dorabella was made by Edward Elgar on July 14, 1897 for his young friend Dora Penny. It is not confirmed a solved code.

Step 12: Francis Bacons Substitution Cipher
Francis Bacons Substitution Cipher

One of Bacons best code was a code that used bold and regular fonts in a certain order to make a new letter. For example "code" would be something like this "FrancisBacon was a cool guy". After you see the sentence put all of the letters in to groups of 5, like this "Franc isBac onwas acool" leave out any extra letters. Once you have it like this you are ready to decode.

*= Regular Letter B= Bold Letter

A= *****

B=****B

C=***B*

D=***BB

E=**B**

F=**B*B

G=**BB*

H=**BBB

I=*B***

J=*B**B

K=*B*B*

L=*B*BB

M=*BB**

N=*BB*B

O=*BBB*

P=*BBBB

Q=B****

R=B***B

S=B**B*

T=B**BB

U=B*B**

V=B*B*B

W=B*BB*

X=B*BBB

Y=BB***

Z=BB**B

Step 13: Grid Transposition Cipher
Grid Transposition Cipher
Grid Transposition Cipher

The Grid Transposition cipher is just another type of transposition cipher. First make a grid that can fit all of the letters, you can do that by taking the square root of the total number of letters, if it comes out as a decimals round up. If there are extra spaces add X's. Then you scatter the numbers in a random order. Then Match the coordinates onto the second grid. Best codes would come out as EDSEBSCTO. To decode it all you need to do is make another grid with the letters in the correct order. Finally Match the coordinates onto the correct grid.

Step 14: Keyboard Code
Keyboard Code

The Keyboard Code is just the order of letters your keyboard.

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

Q W E R T Y U I O P A S D F G H J K L Z X C V B N M

Step 15: Morse Code
Morse Code
Morse Code

Morse code was invented by Samuel Morse and was used in the early 1800's to message people in a telegram. It is a series of beeps that are short and long. For example _ is called a dash and it would be a long beep, and . would be dot and it would be a short beep.

Step 16: Phone Code
Phone Code

The Phone code is really cool because not a lot of people know it. It is just the number the letter is on and then what number it is on that number. For example A is on 1st number on 2 so it would be 2 1

2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 5 5 5 6 6 6 7 7 7 7 8 8 8 9 9 9 9

1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 1 2 3 4

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

Step 17: Pigpen Cipher
Pigpen Cipher
Pigpen Cipher

The Pigpen Cipher was created by the Freemasons so they could keep documents safe. It was also used by the confederate soldiers during the Civil War. It is called The Pigpen Cipher because the box's look like pigpens and the dots look like pigs. It seems complicated but it isn't really. The lines surrounding the letter and the dots within those lines are the symbols.

Step 18: Rosicrucian Cipher
Rosicrucian Cipher

The Rosicrucian Cipher is almost exactly like the the Pigpen Cipher. The symbol that the letter is inside is the symbol that you put for that letter.

Step 19: ROT Cipher
ROT Cipher
Rot Cipher

The Rot Cipher is when you take a letter and put it back or fourth to equal a different letter. An example of this would be -1 equals A=Z. +1 equals A+B It is Related to the Caesar Cipher.

This is a Print out of the Rot Cipher Wheel. Cut out the 2 circles leaving the inner circle NOT HOLLOW. Then you stick a tack or a paper clip through the middle of the inner wheel. Then you can spin it around to do your cipher.

Step 20: Rout Cipher
Rout Cipher
Rout Cipher

The Rout Cipher is your message in a patter kind of like a word search. You make an arrow in the direction of the first two or three letters and then leave it to the other person to do the rest. To make is easier you can make an arrow all the way through.

Step 21: Scytale
Scytale
Scytale

The cylinder decodes for you!

To make a cylinder cipher you need long strip of paper and cylinder.

Wrap the paper around the cylinder so there are no parts of the cylinder showing.

You can temporarily tape down the edges to help you with this part. write your message across the cylinder (write 1 or 2 letters on each part of the strip) Then unwrap the paper from the cylinder.

You can't decode the cipher unless you have a cylinder the same diameter as the one it was made on.

Step 22: Tap Codes
Tap Codes
Tap Code

The Tap Code was used by Vietnam prisoners to communicate, usually by tapping on metal bars or walls. It is a combination of Morse Code and the Grid Code replacing K with a C or X. the dots (.) tell you what numbers to go to from top to side, and the dash's (/) tell you when to separate a word.

Step 23: The Grid Code
The Grid Code
The Grid Code

The Grid Code is a 5x5 grid. It is very simple.

Step 24: Transposition Cipher
Transposition Cipher
Transposition Cipher

Transposition Ciphers can be words written backwards for example (you are cool)=(uoy era looc). It could also be every pair or every 3 letters a pair of letters are swapped. An example of that would be (you are cool)=(oya uer oclo)

Step 25: Vigenere Cipher

Vigenere Cipher
Vigenere Cipher

The Vigenere Cipher is a 26x26 grid of letters a-z. It is a more complicated cipher so I will have to try to demonstrate with explaining battle ship.

Directions

1. Choose a code word (any word. no numbers)

2. Write it like this (my code word will be "code") i m t r y i n g t o e x p l a i n h o w t o d o t h i s it doesn't matter if the code word cant fit evenly c o d e c o d e c o d e c o d e c o d e c o d e c o d e

3. Look at the grid and follow the row i and the column c to the intersection like in battle ship. the letter they intersect on is k. that is how you encode it. To decode it take the code letter in this case c and go until you find k. Then go up all the way so you will find i.

Step 26: Wig Wag
Wig Wag
Wig Wag

Wig Wag was used in the civil war to communicate during battles. It is pretty easy to do, you just have to remember that you don't have to write out all of some words.
